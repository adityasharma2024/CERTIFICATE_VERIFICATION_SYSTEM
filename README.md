##  A Blockchain-Based Certificate Verification System is a decentralized application (DApp) that ensures the authenticity, immutability, and easy verification of certificates (such as academic degrees, training certificates, etc.) using blockchain technology.
Key Features
1.	Tamper-Proof Certificates: Once issued, certificates cannot be altered or deleted.
2.	Decentralized Verification: Anyone can verify a certificate from anywhere, at any time.
3.	Role-Based Access Control: Only authorized institutions can issue and revoke certificates.
4.	Immutable Records: Certificates are permanently stored on the blockchain.
5.	Transparent & Trustworthy: Eliminates the need for manual verification and intermediaries.
6.	Revocation Mechanism: Issuers can revoke certificates if necessary (e.g., error or fraud).
